## Getting Started

This playbook is meant to be a collaborate community-led effort and we'd love your contribution! The main way to contribute is to fork the respository where this playbook lives in GitHub, edit pages, and then push them back to us.

We'll check your changes and commit them usually within a week.

Alternatively, you can add a page to this playbook or edit a page in a text document and email it to: deepd@benetech.org.
